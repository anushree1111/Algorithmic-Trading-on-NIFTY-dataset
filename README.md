Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning

Overview
This project involves the application of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to predict the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) 
of stocks for top 65 companies listed in the Indian stock market. Using historical stock data from 2000 to 2021, the model learns to predict 
the VWAP, providing valuable insights for potential stock market investments. The model's best performance on unseen data has an error of just 0.3342%.
